<h3>let me introduce some details about my course</h3>
  <p>As i said above i'm studing <strong>computer science.</strong></p>
<p> <strong>computer science</strong> is  is the study of computers and computational systems.
   Unlike electrical and computer engineers, computer scientists deal mostly with software and software systems;
    this includes their theory, design, development, and application. </p>

      <td>c++ programming</td>
      <td>C++ is a general-purpose object-oriented programming (OOP) language, developed by Bjarne Stroustrup, and is an extension of the C language. It is therefore possible to code C++ in a "C style" or "object-oriented style</td>

      <td>Java is a programming language that produces software for multiple platforms. When a programmer writes a Java application, the compiled code (known as bytecode) runs on most operating systems (OS), including Windows, Linux and Mac OS. Java derives much of its syntax from the C and C++ programming languages.

      <td>software engineering</td>
      <td>Software engineering is the process of analyzing user needs and designing, constructing, and testing end user applications that will satisfy these needs through the use of software programming languages. It is the application of engineering principles to software development. In contrast to simple programming, software engineering is used for larger and more complex software systems, which are used as critical systems for businesses and organizations.</td>
